      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <article class='course'>
        
        <div class="descrition">
          <p>I am currently a student studying Automation and Information Engineering in the Chemical Industry at UIAM STU. I have a strong passion for software development and data analysis, and I am keen on applying these skills in practical settings.</p>
          
          <p>During my professional experience at Asseco Solutions as a Junior IT Tester, I was primarily focused on manual testing for public administration in the healthcare sector. I worked with their testing environment and utilized tools like Excel and JIRA for task management. This role deepened my understanding of testing processes and the importance of delivering high-quality software.</p>

          <p>I am currently working on my bachelor's thesis, which involves developing a web application in Python using the Anvil framework for coffee management in our department. This project has allowed me to enhance my skills in web development, problem-solving, and applying programming knowledge to practical scenarios.</p>

          <!--
          <p>I am detail-oriented, possess strong problem-solving skills, and am dedicated to continuous learning. Throughout my studies, I have worked on various school projects that demonstrate my ability to collaborate effectively and tackle challenges independently. These experiences have improved my communication skills, allowing me to clearly articulate ideas and work smoothly within a team. I am known as a team player who contributes positively to group dynamics.</p>
          -->
          
          <p>My interest in IT and programming has led me to develop proficiency in several programming languages and tools. I have gained hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and software development through both academic projects and personal initiatives. I enjoy the process of creating efficient and effective software solutions, and I am constantly exploring new technologies to upgrade my skills.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, I am highly communicative and enjoy engaging with colleagues to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions. My ability to work well with others and my enthusiasm for learning make me confident that I can bring valuable contributions to your company. I look forward to bringing my skills and enthusiasm to your team and contributing to your innovative projects.</p>
